M13PDFKit
=============
M13PDFKit is an iBooks like PDF viewer that can be embedded in iOS applications. M13PDFKit is based off of [vfr/Reader](https://github.com/vfr/Reader). The backend uses the same classes that Reader uses, the front end has been recreated to match iOS 7's design, and use more up to date features, like UICollectionViews.

Issues:
-------------
There are two issues I am unable to resolve with the framework, and would like help solving.

1) The viewer has trouble handling rotation. Upon rotation the page that is currently displayed on screen does not resize to the proper size. Once you switch pages though, everything is fine.

2) Zooming in on pages does not allow panning. Something is overrideing the content offset while panning, and not calling "setContentOffset:{0, 0}". The pan gesture for the scroll view send the proper content offset, but the scroll view does not pan. When you pan again, the content offset starts from 0 again. It was working, but while trying to fix rotation, this broke, and I can't figure out what is wrong.
